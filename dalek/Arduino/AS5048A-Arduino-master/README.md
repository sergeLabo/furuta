AS5048A-Arduino
===============

**unmaintained as of some time in 2017** - please see https://github.com/ZoetropeLabs/AS5048A-Arduino/pull/7 for what look like some really good improvements, however I cannot even find an AS5048A to test on now.

A simple SPI library to interface with Austria Microsystem's AS5048A angle sensor with an Arduino.

The sensor should be connected to the hardware SPI pins (MISO, MOSI, SCK). The CS pin can be connected to any GPIO pin but should be passed to the constructor.
